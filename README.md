# mixed-messages
A message generator program

This is a codecademy project.
=============================

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new randomized output. You're welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

*Project Objectives:*

- Build a message generator program using Javascript
- Ÿol
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

8 project tasks that are to be moved from To Do to In Progress to Done.

1. Plan your project

Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

2. Come Up with a Topic

Decide on what types of messages you want your program to output.

3. Create script and run it locally

On your computer, create a JavaScript file to write your code in. Make sure you are able to run your script locally in Node.

4. Set up version control

Set up Git tracking in your directory and add and commit changes as you make them.

5. Create the message

Add functionality to randomly select the different message components so they can create a cohesive message.

6. Put the program together

Combine the different parts of your program so the random messages are selected, combined, and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.

7. Store message components

Decide how to store all of the message components for your game.

8. Next Steps

You’re welcome to expand your program beyond these project tasks and get creative!
